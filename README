The scripts in this folder have been written by BioinformaticsCore for
switchLab. Their purpose is to analyze SNP's to see if they change the
structure and tendency to aggregate of a protein.

To perform an analysis you must make a folder/directory, put in that folder
the VCF file, rename it in.vcf then with that folder as working directory
execute the command :
  qsub -cwd -b y <scriptdir>/masterscript.pl
It is important to use the same annotated genome as was used to generate
the VCF file. If you used something else than hg19 you will need to edit
the file masterscript.pl.

See README_OUTPUT for a description of the content of the major output files.

The script uses a database with PDB files created by switchLab. If this
database is updated or you need an alternative, it is necessary to
recreate the BLAST database. Execute the commands :
  extractseqfromPDB.pl
  makeblastdb -dbtype prot -in PDBsequences.fa -out PDB

The script also uses a NP_* NM_* RefSeq correspondence table and a table with
UniProt standard (preferred) transcripts. See respectively the scripts
makeNP_NMtable.pl and makeNM_ACtable.pl for how to make them.

NOTE :
1. You can restrict the output and the CPU time used by analyzing only one
   alternative transcript per mutated gene, using the UniProt standards. The
   current version of masterscript.pl proposes this by default. Note however
   that you loose quite some data since some genes are not in the list and
   some mutations are not in the standard transcript.
2. You can perform a PolyPhen analysis. PolyPhen takes as input a SNP and
   predicts the structural effect on a standard protein product of the gene.
   This is however only possible for the hg19 genome and is quite CPU
   intensive. The current version of masterscript.pl does not do this by
   default.
3. The lists with standard transcripts in the UniProt and PolyPhen databases
   do not coincide strictly. Therefore it is not recommended to do both
   1 and 2.
